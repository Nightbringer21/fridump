# Disclaimer 

This repo is just a fork from https://github.com/Nightbringer21/fridump/ and is only applying a fix so that Fridump is working with Python3.

It was tested with Python 3.6 on macOS 10.12.


# Fridump
Fridump (v0.1) is an open source memory dumping tool, primarily aimed to penetration testers and developers. Fridump is using the Frida framework to dump accessible memory addresses from any platform supported. It can be used from a Windows, Linux or Mac OS X system to dump the memory of an iOS, Android or Windows application.

Usage
---

How to:

      fridump [-h] [-o dir] [-u] [-v] [-r] [-s] [--max-size bytes] process

The following are the main flags that can be used with fridump:

      positional arguments:
      process            the process that you will be injecting to

      optional arguments:
      -h, --help         show this help message and exit
      -o dir, --out dir  provide full output directory path. (def: 'dump')
      -u, --usb          device connected over usb
      -v, --verbose      verbose
      -r, --read-only    dump read-only parts of memory. More data, more errors
      -s, --strings      run strings on all dump files. Saved in output dir.
      --max-size bytes   maximum size of dump file in bytes (def: 20971520)

To find the name of a local process, you can use:

      frida-ps
For a process that is running on a USB connected device, you can use:

      frida-ps -U

Examples:

      fridump -u Safari   -   Dump the memory of an iOS device associated with the Safari app
      fridump -u -s com.example.WebApp   -  Dump the memory of an Android device and run strings on all dump files
      fridump -r -o [full_path]  -  Dump the memory of a local application and save it to the specified directory

Installation
---
To install Fridump you just need to clone it from git and run it:

      git clone https://github.com/Nightbringer21/fridump.git
            
      python fridump.py -h
            
Pre-requisites
---
To use fridump you need to have frida installed on your python environment and frida-server on the device you are trying to dump the memory from.
The easiest way to install frida on your python is using pip:

    pip install frida
    
More information on how to install Frida can be found [here](http://www.frida.re/docs/installation/)

For iOS, installation instructions can be found [here](http://www.frida.re/docs/ios/).

For Android, installation instructions can be found [here](http://www.frida.re/docs/android/).

Note: On Android devices, make sure that the frida-server binary is running as root!

Disclaimer

* This is version 0.1 of the software, so I expect some bugs to be present
* I am not a developer, so my coding skills might not be the best

This tool has been tested on a Windows 7 and a Mac OS X laptop, dumping the memory of:  
* an iPad Air 2 running iOS 8.2
* a Galaxy Tab running Cyanogenmod 4.4.4
* a Windows 7 laptop.
 
Therefore, if this tool is not working for you, I apologise and I will try to fix it.

Any suggestions and comments are welcome!
