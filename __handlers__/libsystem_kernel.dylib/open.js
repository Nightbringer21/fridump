     * For example use Memory.readUtf8String(args[0]) if the first argument is a pointer to a C string encoded as UTF-8.
     * It is also possible to modify arguments by assigning a NativePointer object to an element of this array.
     * @param {object} state - Object allowing you to keep state across function calls.
     * Only one JavaScript function will execute at a time, so do not worry about race-conditions.
     * However, do not use this to store function arguments across onEnter/onLeave, but instead
     * use "this" which is an object for keeping state local to an invocation.
